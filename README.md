# Spam-Detection-Naive-Bayes
Naive Bayes is a popular machine learning algorithm used for spam detection. It is a simple yet effective algorithm that makes use of Bayes' theorem and assumes independence between the features. Naive Bayes has been widely used in text classification tasks, including spam detection, because of its ability to handle large feature spaces and its computational efficiency.

Here's how the Naive Bayes algorithm can be applied to spam detection:

1. Data Preparation: You need a labeled dataset consisting of pre-classified emails as spam or non-spam (ham). Each email is represented as a feature vector, where each feature corresponds to a specific word or term in the email. Additionally, you'll need to preprocess the data by removing stop words, converting words to lowercase, and applying other techniques like stemming or lemmatization.

2. Feature Extraction: The next step is to extract features from the emails. Commonly used features include the presence or absence of specific words, the frequency of words, or even more advanced techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) representation, which assigns weights to words based on their importance in the document.

3. Training the Naive Bayes Classifier: Once you have your feature vectors ready, you can train the Naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm calculates the probability of an email being spam or ham given the presence of specific features. It assumes that the presence or absence of each feature is independent of the others, which is a naive assumption (hence the name "naive" Bayes). During training, the algorithm estimates the prior probabilities (spam or ham) and calculates the likelihood probabilities of each feature occurring given the class (spam or ham).

4. Classifying New Emails: After training the classifier, you can use it to classify new, unseen emails. The algorithm calculates the probability of an email belonging to each class (spam or ham) given its features using Bayes' theorem. The class with the highest probability is assigned to the email. In other words, the classifier predicts whether the email is spam or ham based on the calculated probabilities.

It's important to note that Naive Bayes assumes independence between the features, which might not hold true for all datasets. However, despite this simplifying assumption, Naive Bayes has been proven to work well in practice, especially for text classification tasks like spam detection.

Keep in mind that this is just a high-level overview of applying Naive Bayes to spam detection. There are variations of the algorithm, such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, which are specifically designed for discrete feature spaces like word counts. Additionally, preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, and model evaluation are important aspects that require attention for effective spam detection.
